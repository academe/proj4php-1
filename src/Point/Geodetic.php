/**
 * A Geodetic point value object.
 * Geodetic coordinates consist of latitude ϕ (phi), longitude λ (lambda) and height h.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_conversion
 *
 * This is an unprojected point.
 *
 * Some projected points will be geodetic too, and some will not.
 * CHECKME: perhaps "geodetic" is an encompassing term and this needs to be
 * more specific, e.g. LatLong?
