/**
 * An ENU (East North Up) point value object.
 * This is a geocentric coordinate based on a location on a surface grid.
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axes_conventions#Ground_reference_frames:_ENU_and_NED
 * TODO: also NED, North East Down, used mainly by aerospace.
 * There are other map system specific point definitions.
 *
 * This is effectively a point on a projection, so there will be lots of variations on how
 * they are defined.
